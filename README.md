# Stitch Calculator

**Designed and developed by Sarah J. Stauber.**

Have you ever struggled to increase or decrease crochet or knit work evenly? I created this tool after struggling to calculate how many stitches to pick up on crochet ribbing for a beanie. 

_Please feel free to use pieces of this codebase and credit Sarah J. Stauber._

If you find any issues, please let me know! I'm working to make this a highly accessible tool for all devices.
